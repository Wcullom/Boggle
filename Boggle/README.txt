CS351 Boggle (Project 2)

My Boggle program is running and operational. 

When you run the JAR file you will have a window that displays the name of the game 
as well as an option for a 5x5 Board and a 4x4 board.

Once you have choosen your Board size the next window will then display the actual game.
The actual game will have the timer, score, and words you have guessed in the top left. 
To select a letter you simply click the button and it will add it to your word you want to 
submit. If you try to hit the same letter it will flash yellow, letting you know that you have 
already used this button. Once you have completed your choice of letters, you will hit the submit
button on the right hand side. 

The submit button will take your word, score it (or reject it in red), and display it in the guessed
words section on the left. 

The timer will start as soon as you choose which board you want to play. When the timer expires the game will end.
When the game ends a new window will pop up that will display how many points you scored and how accurate you were.
